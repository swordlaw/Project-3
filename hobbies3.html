      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>This page is here to show who I am outside of a professional of school enviroment</p>
      <h2>Photography & Videography</h2>
      <p>Although I don't go out and take photoes or make short movies as much I'd want to, it is still one of my
        passions. Many don't know this about me but I was strongly considering going to film school. I hope to start
        getting out more to take photos and film short movies like I did back in high School, this time with the
        beautiful streets of Chicago to play in.</p>
     <p>My go-to cameras:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Canon Rebel SL1</li>
         <li>Gopro Hero 5 Session</li>
       </ul>

        <h2>Video Games</h2>
        <p>I have been playing video games for as long as I can remember. I started out playing on the orginal Play
        Station, and have playd on a consle from every generation since. My favorite console of all time probably has
        to be the Nintendo Game Cube, mostly for the nostalgia. I mostly play consloe games but plan on buiding a
        gaming pc in the near future. I love how video games can give you an escape from real life, and I think I
        appreciate that now more than ever.</p>
